## We are working the back end on this one boys, NoSql for the win.

<br>

This assignment involves a few critirium... is that spelled right? Anyway, there's a few things we need to knock out in order to get all the points.

- When i start the app, the server and Mongoose are linked to the MongoDB database.

- When I test users and thoughts in Insomnia, I get a JSON formatted return

- When I test Post, Put, and Delete in Insomnia, I am successful.

- I am also able to us Post and Delete in Insomnia to post and remove thoughts, as well as update a friend's list.

<br>

## For this challenge, I'll be using some (if not all) of the following components... here is where you'll wish me luck.

- Express JS
- Mongoose (for the Mongo ODM)
- MongoDB
- Java Script
